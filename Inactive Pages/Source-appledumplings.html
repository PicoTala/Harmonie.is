<h2>Apple Dumpling Recipe</h2>

<p>I haven't changed this recipe very much since I found it online years ago, so I can't take full credit for how magical it is. I've also lost track of where I found the original recipe, sadly. However, I'll include my notes and thoughts on how I've made my own changes to it since then.</p>

<h3>
Steps to Prepare the Dumpling Dough:
</h4>
<p>Please note: I have found that mixing this dough by hand gets me the best results. 
  This dough is very tough, and I avoid mixing it by hand if I have any nail polish on my nails at the time. 
  As always, wash your hands thoroughly before mixing the dough. The consistency is important, and it will help 
  you to have a helper ready with more milk, should the dough not be the right 'feel.'</p>
</p>
If you do have access to a stand mixer, I would use a dough hook, and monitor it, as the dough is very solid.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Combine flour, baking powder and salt.</li>
  <li>Slice up shortening into smaller amounts and add while mixing, until the mixture resembles course meal.</li>
  <li>Gradually add the milk. You want the dough to not stick to your fingers when you hold it, and if you have been mixing by hand, any dough sticking to your hands should come off and return to the ball as you mix it. Add additional milk as needed.</li>
  <li>Roll dough into a rectangular shape, roughly &frac18;" thick. If you are not able to roll the dough, or prefer not to, you can also skip this step and the next. Later, we will form the dumplings by hand, but they may be smaller. It is best to roll them if you intend to make large ones, or include more than apples.</li>
  <li>Cut into roughly 5" squares.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="fillingsteps">
<h3>Steps to prepare the filling</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Combine apple pieces, white sugar, butter, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl and mix thoroughly.</li>
  <li>If you have extra filling, it can be places in the pan around the dumplings. If what you have chosen to add (raisins, nuts, other fruits) would not cook well directly in the syrup, mix these ingredients in a seperate bowl.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="assemble">
<h3>Assemble the Dumplings:</h3>
<p>Please note: if you have an assistant, this would be a nice time for them to prepare the syrup, while you assemble the dumplings. Have the pan you plan to bake it in ready, and place the finished dumplings directly into it. Try to give them some space between them, about a half-inch, as they will expand a little.</p>
<ol>
  <li>If you have chosen to roll the dough and cut into squares, you can take the filling and place a small amount in the center of each square, then fold the edges around it.</li>
  <li>If you have chosen to skip rolling the dough, take a palm-sized amount of dough, and shape it, to form a bowl-shape. Place the filling inside of it, and cup your hands around the ball to shape the dough.</li>
  <li>Wet your fingers with water and use it to pinch any edges of dough together.</li>
  <li>If you want to, brush the tops with melted butter, and sprinkle with sugar, cinnamon, or any other spices you favor, but keep it light.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="syrupsteps">
<h3>Make the Syrup:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Combine sugar, water, cinnamon, nutmeg, and butter in a saucepan.</li>
  <li>Stir to combine over medium heat, taking care to not burn or overheat. Syrup will thicken and begin to take on a traditional syrupy look.</li>
  <li>When syrup is done, pour it over the dumplings, taking care to not 'wash' off too much of the additional spices you may have sprinkled on the top of them.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>Baking Instructions</h2>
<p>Cover the dumplings with foil, and bake at 375&deg; for 35 to 45 minutes. You're looking for the tops to get golden brown. When you take it out, be careful to not slosh any syrup on your hands, and give it time to cool, uncovered, for 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
