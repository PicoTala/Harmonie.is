<h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
<p>Prep box of pilaf to cook while mushrooms are going. Cook mushrooms in cast iron until they start to get nice crispy parts. Add diced pepper, onion and garlic. Season with herbs and stir around. When the whole thing gets fried up again, add a tablespoon or two of the broth just to deglaze the pan and stir.</p>
<p>Get large dish and add maybe a tablespoon or so of sauce to the bottom, not too much that you can't still see through it. Lay out pepper halves and sprinkle a small bit of cheese on them.</p>
<p>Combine veggie mixture with pilaf and most of the rest of the spaghetti sauce until it holds together and looks like you'd be fine to just eat it that way. Spoon into pepper bowls, nudge mixture into edges and almost overstuff. Drizzle about a spoonful of sauce on top of each and sprinkle more cheese. Add leftover stuffing in spaces around peppers and top with remaining leftover sauce. Add a tablespoon or two of veggie broth in pan around peppers.</p>
<p>Bake at 420 for about an hour, let cool and serve.</p>
