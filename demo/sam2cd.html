            <h3>Flyer & Poster Design</h3>
            <p>
              Clients have different needs based on their brands and clientel.
              From mundane forms and schedules to eye catching advertisements,
              my eye for design has enabled me to find creative solutions for a
              broad spectrum of clients and brands.

              There have been many different functions and demographics that
              have required poster design work. I did variations of formatting
              for professional events at PEM and through freelance contracts for
              fundraisers and promotion. Whether it is to promote an event,
              inform viewers, or get people curious, posters serve to give the
              public information both visually and with words. Here are a few
              examples of different types of events I designed for. The first is
              a lecture from a Dutch furniture maker and antique collector about
              dollhouses geared towards adults. Secondly, is a poster promoting
              a new children’s exhibit about the phases of water. It needs to
              grab kids’ attention as well as inform the parents. The third is a
              poster for the City of Haverhill’s Art Association’s postcard
              fundraiser geared towards get a younger generation involved with
              the local art scene as well as raise funds for upcoming events.
