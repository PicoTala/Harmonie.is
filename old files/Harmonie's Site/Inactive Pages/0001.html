<H1>Playlist Title</h1>
<p>These are songs that I felt spoke to different kinds of love: self-love, the fuzzy, weird inbetween, and the steady hum of a love with roots. I like a love that is human and honest, and started this with songs that spoke to loving yourself, as the old rule of "love yourself and others will follow" has in my experience been quite wise.</p>
